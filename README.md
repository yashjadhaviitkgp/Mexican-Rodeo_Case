## 🚀 Project Overview

Mexican Rodeo, a Mexican cuisine startup based in Surat, India, was looking to expand sustainably in a competitive market. The objective was to design a scalable business model that would:

- Minimize operational costs
- Maximize market visibility
- Ensure long-term profitability
- Enable rapid expansion through franchising

## 📊 Key Contributions

- 🏗️ Business Model Shift (COFO → FOFO):  
  Recommended a two-phase franchising approach.  
  - Phase 1: Adopted Company-Owned Franchise-Operated (COFO) model to ensure quality and brand control.  
  - Phase 2: Proposed gradual transition to Franchise-Owned Franchise-Operated (FOFO) for rapid scale-up and reduced capital expenditure.  
  → Result: 30% reduction in initial expansion costs.

- 🚚 Food Truck Concept:  
  Designed a mobile food truck model for beach and high-footfall areas with limited QSR infrastructure.  
  → Result: Reduced overhead by 40% while boosting brand visibility.

- 📈 Profitability Strategy:  
  Performed detailed SWOT analysis, recommended lean operations, and efficient staffing strategies.  
  → Result: Projected 5–7% increase in profit margins.
